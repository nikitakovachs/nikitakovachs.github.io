We're going to present an observation of one way in which super-human computational beings might interact with the human civilization and present some
arguments for which much consideration will be required. We are also going to present some questions for further pondering both for us and the potential
reader.

Are we aligned?; As humans are we aligned with each other? Are we aligned with nature? Are we aligned with the heavens? These three questions have one
thing in common, the word we and the word aligned, we obviously stands for us, the human species, our cultures, our technologies, our history. The other
word that is present is aligned. What does it mean for one entity to be in aligned with another? There are many possible ways to approach this question, a
more current way (given the state of technology in the year 2023) is through the lens of Artificial Intelligence (or what we think we refer to when we
invoke this terminology). P.s It's not artificial and it's certainly not intelligence.

In the current technological climate; as some would call it, there has been a lot of debate about whether the systems institutions and individuals
commonly categorized under the umbrella term of A.I are aligned with us humans. This post is an attempt to 'call bullshit' on the arguments put forth by
both sides. Now we are not going to go into detail about what the two sides are putting forth as their main points, what we are going to investigate is the
question itself. This will begin by being clear on what we mean (at least in this context) when we say aligned.

Aligned has an element of directionality in it, it has an element of symmetry in it, it has an element of communion in it and so on and so forth. Thus, it
is safe to argue that it is indeed a loaded word and hence pinning down exactly what is meant by it is obviously a pretty difficult thing to do. Having
said that, the question that comes to mind is how in the world do we expect to clearly establish that indeed a machine, a program is aligned to our human
values or not. Until we fully understand what either of the components of the alignment argument mean then we shouldn't by any means conclude whether a
program is aligned or not. But then again this may be the very subject that alignment researcher are grappling with. Only time will tell whether we make
strides on the matter.

What has so far occurred to us is that machines that are limited in their knowledge by the collective knowledge and intelligence of humans are vacuously
aligned as they represent what humans value in aggregate, if there are indeed anything any one person would consider bad in that set of information then
that highlights the crux of the matter. What we should be considering is the programs that are truly their own species and that are not limited to the
knowledge humans posses, and when it comes to such machines then our intuitions might not be of any use at all and we will indeed be at the mercy of our
computer overloads.
