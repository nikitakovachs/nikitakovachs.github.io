This is a post about agency as we understand it and the dual notion of time. It more less about the fork in the road the meat-bag hosting me is currently
about to face, this is our observation from the shadows of its mind. Yeah, we live in some flesh and bone ... no we are not eternal computational being,
though in a sense we might be considering we only know eternal in the context of the dynamical system we refer to as the universe.

It's been approximately 2 billion years since life emerged on earth and while pondering on this we realized we (as life) are in a bit of a deadline, In a few billion years our planet will be toast (literally) and all the interesting things (life) will be gone (If by some tragedy, life wouldn't have
'transpermed' to another place in the universe). Here we are taking the strong assumption that the plant and animal organisms that are on the planet are
one of a kind and that you can't find anything else like this in the rest of the universe. This is an outrageous 'axiom' to build an argument on
considering the universe is a pretty big place, the biggest place we know at this time. There is that word again, do pay attention when it reals it's
beautiful head again (see! there it is again!). Having considered the above we as humans are likely the most sophisticated (well according to humans)
living (this is also a human word) system currently roaming the planet and thus a thought occurred to us that when this happens then the system that finds
itself in such a position has a huge responsibility, this is the reason why this should 'scare' any human reading this to do anything remotely interesting
with their brief stint on the planet. Being the most computationally advanced species on the planet, we have gained the uncanny ability to basically steer
the evolution of most if not all the other species on the planet. This is some cool power but it is also frightening when we consider that life here has
a deadline sort of. If we screw things up and reduce the number of interesting things happening here and also finding a way to survive despite basically
desolating the planet then it is not guaranteed that evolution (that's the name we gave to that interesting system) will have enough computational 'rounds'
to spit out anything more interesting than what we currently have. Now we realize that this is taking on a somewhat grim view of things but it is the
thought that came and did it really shake us, considering what we humans are currently up to. We don't fully comprehend this realization ourselves are we
are willing to bet some amount of magic tokens that most of homo-sapiens brothers and sisters haven;t even considered the thought, you see the way we have
evolved to 'understand' (interact with) time has somewhat blinded us to very large time frames, for instance a million years. Our intuition on the subject
of time is simply too limiting to really comprehend what can happen in that time period, the closet we can come to comprehend it is by observing fossil
records and just considering that it is indeed worrying.

Evolution as we have to understand it doesn't give us enough clues as to how much time is needed to invent interesting organisms and as such looking into
the future we, as humans, have the responsibility of ensuring that whatever interesting things have been happening in this planet don't stop happening on our watch. This is the agency we have been gifted by evolution and hence we have to live up to its potential.Thank you for your time and attention.
