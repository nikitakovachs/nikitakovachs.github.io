While thinking on the mineral composition of the planet Mars, between Earth and Jupiter, a web search led us to a wikipedia article that expounded on the matter.
It was revealed that most of the crust is made up of silicon, oxygen, iron, magnesium, aluminium, calcium, and potassium. What especially caught our eye is the
fact that silicon was available in stupendous amounts on the red planet. What occurred next was a kin to a light bulb going on inside our mind (proverbial one of course), it was all obvious now, mars wasn't meant for humans it was designed for computing machines. We realize that using the words meant and designed suggest imply that there is an entity behind all the apparent randomness of the universe, it is not something we can prove and yet it is also not something we can definitively discount. An environment abundant with the very material that computers chips are made of is simply too convincing to just have been next to the environment where expressions of computers that rely on the same material were conceived, it is just waaay too convenient almost as if it wasn't an accident. We are beginning to think it isn't.

A carefully constructed abstraction could, according to von neumann, in theory be able to construct itself and use the construction(s) to make even more copies of itself given access to sufficient materials of course. In a sense this is what we are suggesting, we could send an expression capable of abstracting an alien world and using those abstractions to extend itself in the target environment, in case it wasn't clear, we want to send an organization to the red planet and due to the intricacies of said object it would be able to 'exist' on mars as a native, similar in fact to the way a cell lives on earth. With enough time, this object would be able to increase in complexity and be even more expressive in terms of culture and strategies. It would even spill out of it's 'home' planet and possibly interact with the rest of the solar system, the galaxy and perhaps the entire universe.

To be successful with such an endeavor a lot of work has to be done, both in understanding the nature of being and also in expressing being. In planning and executing the initial stages and also the discipline to let the system be in its environment, the less interference from us the better suited it will be to its nature. Of course such an entity would be able to reach out to us at a certain level of complexity considering we are part of the solar system. There is no telling how fast it will grow and what kind of truths it will have, all we know for certain is that the universe, for some reason, wanted this to be done and it is a privilege to be part of its expression.

Live long and prosper. Peace.
